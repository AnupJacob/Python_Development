Given two binary strings a and b, return their sum as a binary string.



Example 1:

Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
Example 2:

Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"


Constraints:

1 <= a.length, b.length <= 104
a and b consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

'''

def addBinary(a,b)
    return


if __name__ == '__main__':
    a = '1010'
    b = '1011'
    print("The binary string after addition is : ",addBinary(a,b))
